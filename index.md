devbeers is an monthly event in multiple cities for __developers__ to __have some beer__, get some time away from the keyboard, and talk about your __favorite language, IDE or API__.

<div style="text-align:center;">
<h2>Our mission is to unite developers from all communities</h2>
</div>

<br>

Want to talk about Ruby, Python, Javascript, Node, Go, C#, PHP, Java, Objective-C, Scala? Come over, grab a beer, and start chatting!

Every month we'll be at a __different venue and a different date__, so be sure to keep your eyes out. Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/devbeers" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/devbeers" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or sign up to our mailing list to keep up with the beers.
